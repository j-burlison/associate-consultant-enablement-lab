# Bootcamp Packets

This collection of packets will help bootstrap your bootcamp experience by developing a working vocabulary and base set of knowledge around our most commonly used frameworks and technologies in consulting. 


# Day 1: First Things First

Set up your local development environment by following the directions in the *Development-Environment* packet. That will get you primed for the lab, as well as the rest of the packets.

At the end of today you should be able to run the following commands without any errors:

```sh
git --version
```

```sh
java -version
```

```sh
mvn -v
```

If you have any errors with any of these commands, please reach out to your regional facilitator.
